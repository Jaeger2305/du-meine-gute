## Getting started

There are some READMEs in the folders, as well as a docs folder for more general information, including an architecture diagram.

Locally, a lot is configured in the docker-compose file. This does need your IP address to set up the Kafka instance though.

`MY_IP=192.168.178.55 docker-compose up -d`
